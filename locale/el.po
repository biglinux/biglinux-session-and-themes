"the same principle as before, we can use a translation tool to convert the text from en-US to el "
"without any interaction between the two languages. This means that the translation will be done "
"solely based on the linguistic rules and patterns of the target language, without taking into "
"account any cultural or contextual differences between the two languages. This approach may result "
"in a less accurate translation, as it does not consider the nuances and idiomatic expressions of "
"the source language. However, it can still provide a general understanding of the text in the "
"target language."
